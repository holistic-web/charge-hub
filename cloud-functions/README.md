# Cloud Functions

This folder manages the cloud functions for this project. They are auto deployed on development to live or development branches.

There is only "live" for cloud functions, so be careful when making changes.

The functions can be deployed manually by running the following from the root of this project:

```
firebase deploy --only functions
```
